 # What's the Weather Temp Code Challenge

 - Ask for the user for their city.
 - Ask them what unit they would like the temperature in.
 - Call the http://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast API using `requests` to extract the relevant data.
 - Output a nice message back to the user, telling them what the temperate is.

 ## Bonus Challenges

 - Validate their choice of country code by loading in `data/country_codes.csv`.
 - Supply some extra advice (e.g, if its raining, say ‘better bring your umbrella’)
